# AI Workflow

Every implementation task should follow:

```
Read Documentation

↓

Analyse

↓

Plan

↓

Identify Files

↓

Implement

↓

Verify

↓

Summarise

↓

Stop
```

Never implement multiple milestones simultaneously.

# Compiler Workflow

```
Campaign 01.md

↓

Campaign Compiler

↓

campaign.json

↓

Mission Compiler

↓

mission01.json

↓

...

↓

mission21.json

↓

Asset Compiler

↓

Workbook

↓

Parent Guides

↓

Resources

↓

Image Specifications
```

Every compiler must validate against

```
503_DATA_MODEL.md

504_JSON_SCHEMA.md
```

before producing output.

# Definition of Done

The project is complete when:

- The platform runs entirely offline.
- Campaigns are data-driven.
- New campaigns require no platform code changes.
- Curriculum remains hidden from the learner.
- Parent Mode provides full traceability.
- Workbook is optional.
- A child can independently complete a campaign with minimal adult assistance.

# Current Next Action

**Asset Compiler Batch 3 (Missions 11–15) is complete** — notebook instructions, one justified printable (Mission 12's star chart), parent enrichment with curriculum references, embedded vocabulary, image specifications, and a third experiment (Mission 15's signal-path troubleshooting) are all generated. Mission 11 was confirmed to need no experiment despite the resources document's PhET/circuits reference, by scanning its compiled JSON directly. Await approval to start Batch 4 (Missions 16–21), the final batch, which will complete Phase 5.
